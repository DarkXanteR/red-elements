# Canvas

The Canvas component is the main Drawing area, where you can compose the app from nodes, drawn via [D3](https://d3js.org/) (ie. Data Driven Documents Dx3)

The nodes are selected from the `Palette` component, which contains a categorized list of nodes that can be drawn on the Canvas and connected.

Each such node can be configured via the `Node Editor` component (ie. a form with custom fields as per the particular component).

Node-red plugins can be used to register Nodes for particular contexts and scenarios.
