# Common components

The Common components are the main building blocks used for other higher level components.

## Components

- `CheckBoxSet`
- `EditableList`
- ...

## TODO

Each of these components must be wrapped as a Custom Element via lit-html or StencilJS so they can be used as native HTML elements.

For now: Use the original JQuery widgets/components/elements as "controllers" to control most of the state and view logic.
