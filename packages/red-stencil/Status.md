# Status

Pretty good setup. Most components have their full skeleton structure defined, but for now have been moved into `playbox` folder to not intrude with the builder/compiler.

We will add one component at a time, step by step.

Currently a minor jQuery-UI issue is blocking. Is likely quite easy to resolve...

Please see [Issues]() document here in `red-stencil` folder.
