Run the [node-red project on github](https://github.com/node-red/node-red)

See [1.0 Roadmap](https://nodered.org/blog/2017/07/17/roadmap-to-1-dot-0) to get a detailed overview of current status and where project is going...

What about references and use of the `RED` global context object which is empty?
