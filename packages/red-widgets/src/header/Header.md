# Header

For now (legacy node-red) the header is simply a top bar with a logo and the menu to the far right.

We should however make the Header "come alive", with a session section for login/logout and a better menu structure for dealing with projects, repos etc.

The current menu structure is really inconvenient and should be more directly accessible as direct links presented in the interface for quick interaction and easy overview of what is available in the app to play with.

The header needs a re-design to become a real widget like the rest.
